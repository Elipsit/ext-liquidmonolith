## Project Description
The Liquid Monolith invites participants to see the world through different lenses, by presenting them with a fluid moving display that resembles "Rorschach Inkblot Tests" that helps us unravel their dreams.<br/>

### Current Status
This project is in a prototype development stage<br/>
**Here is a working prototype of electromagnets sequencing the ferrofluid in the display panel:**

# Project Research

This project was inspired from a youtube channel called [Applied Procrastination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PFgVtzsXHM)

## Electrical
Several electromagnet coil topologies were tested:
![Coil_options](https://github.com/Elipsit/ext-liquidmonolith/blob/main/pics/prototypes/coil_options.jpg)

I chose to settle of a smaller one that was cheaper. A smaller coil required a system voltage increase from 12V to 24V to maintain the needed force.

Here is our prototype 16 coil array:

## Ferrofluid Tank

### Tank Materials

The demo video from [Applied Procrastination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PFgVtzsXHM) used glass enclosures, but I felt this would be an issue for the Playa.
I chose to research into Acrylic tanks. This was an issues since Ferrofluid is sticky and tends to coat most materials.
Research was done into anti-stick coatings.

Some coatings perfromed better than others:

several glue and epoxy options were tested before a water tight solution was found:

When I was able to build one that perfromed as well as the glass ones I scaled the size to fit the 16 electromagnet demo
